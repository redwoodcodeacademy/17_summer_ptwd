// We are forming a game studio (Redwood Game Studio)!
// Our first game will be a JavaScript based role playing game.
// We are going to create a dungeon, some monsters and ways to fight them.

console.log("\n ** Monster Monster **");
// 1.   Create an array of three objects, each holding a 'monster' object.
//      Each monster should contain the information for its name(string), health (number), and strength (number)
//      Go ahead and choose values that you think are good for each of these.
//      Using a loop print out the name, strength and health of each monster to the console.

console.log("\n ** My Hero! **");
// 2. Create a Hero object with our Hero's stats.
//    Our hero will have a name(string), strength (number), and health (number)
//    Print out the name, strength and health of our hero to the console.

console.log("\n ** Attack of The Hero **");
// 3.   Create a function that allows the hero to attack a monster.
//      The function should take in two objects, the hero and the monster you are attacking.
//      The function should reduce the monster's health by the hero's strength.
//      Using this function, have the hero attack our first monster.
//      Print out all the monster's name and new health to the console.

console.log("\n ** Monster - Dead or Alive **");
// 4.   Add a function to the monster objects that tells us if the monster is alive or not.
//      The monster is alive if the health is greater than 0 and dead if not.
//      Print out all of our monsters' names and alive status to the console.

console.log("\n ** We still ok? **");
// 5.   Add another function to our hero object to tell us if the hero is alive or not.
//      Our hero is alive if his or her health is over 0 and dead if not.
//      Print our hero's name and alive status to the console.

console.log("\n ** Revenge of The Monster **");
// 6.   Now the monsters fight back!
//      Create another function that makes a monster attack our hero.
//      It should take in two parameters, monster and hero that the monster is attacking.
//      The function should reduce the hero's health by the amount of the monster's attack
//      Have the first monster attack our hero and then print out our hero's name, health and alive status.

console.log("\n ** Let's Do This **");
// 7.   Let's take em on!'
//      For each monster in our array, have our hero attack the monster, then have the monster attack our hero.
//      Keep repeating attacks until either the hero or the monster is dead.
//      If our hero dies, then print to the console "GAME OVER"
//      If our hero defeats all three monsters, print to the console "WINNER WINNER"
//      If we won, modify our parameters to make us lose the next one.
//      If we lost, modify our parameters to make us win the next one.
