# Planning - Data Model*
- Figure out what your 'model' needs to look like for your application.  
- For example with our ticket app.  Before we even started building that I sat down and decided that all users needed: firstName, lastName, dob, credit card info, etc.  
- Take time to sit down and figure out what data you are going to need for each piece of your site in order for it to work.  Once you are done with your model go ahead on send it over to me so I can help spot any blind spots before moving forward.

# Planning - WireFrames*
- Once you are done with the data model and its been approved by one of your instructors, its time to grab the pen and paper and sketch out with boxes what this site is actually going to look like.  
- Map out what pages you need, how those pages will interact, and what content ought to go on each page.  
- As you do this you might realize real quick that you need to go back and change your model - its ok to do that and actually encouraged.  Thats why we plan!

# Code - Start with the big picture*
- Get your basic files built with all the appropriate boiler plates.
- Get Angular/jQuery working
- Get Bootstrap working
- Get Angular ui-router working
- Start with the big and general concepts before you dive into any of the details.
- Once you have the skeleton fully functional start diving deeper into the details on each page.

# GitHub - Pushing*
- Make sure your root folder lives on your desktop or most importantly inside of a folder that DOES NOT have git initialized on it.
- Initialize git in the root folder that your project lives in! `git init`
- Start a new repository on GitHub for your project and connect your local folder to it by running `git remote add origin <http string provided by Githubs repo>` in your CLI
- Do your first push and make sure it connects to GitHub.
- Don't forget that your commit messages matter!
