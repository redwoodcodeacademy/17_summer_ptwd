// Today we are building a website for a school district.  The school needs pages for `schools`, `teachers`, `events`, `summer programs`, and `student life`.

// In our new `views` folder add an HTML file with the appropriate h1 tag for each of the pages listed above.

// In our controllers folder create a controller for each of our new pages.  Create a unique $scope variable and print that on the appropriate page.

// Link Angular UI-Router using the CDN and inject the router into our module.
// Build our routes on app.js
// Create a navbar on index.html and add our div with ui-view
