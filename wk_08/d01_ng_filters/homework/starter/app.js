// Our artist needs the following properties
//    - Id
//    - First name / stage name
//    - Last name (optional)
//    - Genre
//    - Tour/Concert name

// Show objects should include the following information
//    - Id
//    - Artist Id
//    - Tour/Concert name
//    - Show Date
//    - Show Location
//    - Ticket count
//    - Ticket price

// Once you've created both the Show and Artist constructors, create 5 artists with 4 shows each to seed our DB.

// Write the HTML/CSS/JS so that our user can CRUD artists.
// In the display view of each artist there should be a new button called "add show"
// When "add show" is selected, a new form should appear at the bottom of the page that our user can fill out to add a new show to that artist.  Once the show has been successfully added that form should disappear once again until another "add show" button is selected.
