var users = []

// Finish the user Contructor to take all of the values provided by the user.
var User = function() {

}

// Seed our users array with 4 default users

// Add a Click event to our submit button that creates a new user and puts them into our users array.

// First and Last name need to be required fields.  If the user doesn't input any data into those fields please present them with appropriate error messages under the input fields that are missing content.

// Create a function called "printUsers" whose job it is is to print our users into the "usersContent" div.

// Add a button on each user card called "update".  When a user clicks that button the form should be populated with their information. Hide the submit Button and show a new button called "update".  Update should have a click event that updates that users data in our users array.

// Add a button on each user card called "delete".  When that button is clicked, remove that user from our users array.
